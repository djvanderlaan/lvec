Version: 0.2.3

Description: Core functionality for working with vectors (numeric, integer,
    logical and character) that are too large to keep in memory. The vectors are
    kept (partially) on disk using memory mapping. This package contains the
    basic functionality for working with these memory mapped vectors (e.g.
    creating, indexing, ordering and sorting) and provides C++ headers which can
    be used by other packages to extend the functionality provided in this
    package.
